## 👨‍💻 About Me
I have been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. I was exposed to computers and tech at a very young age, largely thanks to my father, who has always had a strong interest in technology. Growing up around technology sparked my curiosity and motivated me to learn how things work.

I am currently a **Computer Programming and Analysis** student at **George Brown Polytechnic**, where I am building a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and practical software development through hands-on coursework and continuous learning.
